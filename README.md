# Renormalization-Group-Bialek
This repository is created as part of my thesis in physics. Much of the content is inspired by two papers from Bialek et al. 2016 and 2019.

1) "Coarseâ€“graining and hints of scaling in a population of 1000+ neurons": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11904
2) "PCA meets RG": https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09733
